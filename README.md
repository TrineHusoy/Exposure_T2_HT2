# Exposure_T2_HT2

In this project we used the EuroMix biomonitoring study to estimate the  external exposure of the mycotoxin T2 and HT2 from the diet. You can read more about the Euromix study in Hus??y et al. 2019 (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412019306944?via%3Dihub). The exposure assessment were performed per meal for a selected individuals who had high consumption of oat and/or oat containing food items, since T2 and HT2 toxin is found in highest concentrations in oat.
